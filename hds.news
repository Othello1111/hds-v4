HDS Library
-----------

   A workaround for problems with data synchronization when using
mapped files over NFS together with some Linux kernels has been introduced. 


   A new (V4.3-3) of the Hierarchical Data System HDS is now
available.

   This version contains a minor internal change for compatibility
with the latest version of Linux.
